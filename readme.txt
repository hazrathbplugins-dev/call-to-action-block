Example block scaffolded with Create Block tool.

== Description ==

A powerful and customizable Gutenberg block that helps you create attention-grabbing <code>call-to-action</code> sections with ease. Designed for modern WordPress websites, this block allows you to showcase messages, buttons, and offers that drive user engagement and conversions.

For backwards compatibility, if this section is missing, the full length of the short description will be used, and
Markdown parsed.

== Installation ==

Follow these steps to install and use the Call To Action block:

1. In your WordPress admin, go to `Plugins` → `Add New` → `Upload Plugin` and select the `call-to-action-block.zip` file.
2. Click `Install Now`, then `Activate`.
3. Alternatively, manually upload the `call-to-action-block` folder to `/wp-content/plugins/` via SFTP/FTP and activate it.
4. Open any post or page in the Block Editor (Gutenberg), click the `+` inserter, and search for `Call To Action`.
5. Add the block and configure its settings (title, description, button text, link URL, alignment, and styles).
6. Update or publish the post/page to see the block on the front end.

Requirements:
- WordPress 6.0+ and PHP 7.4+.
- The Block Editor (Gutenberg) enabled.

Troubleshooting:
- If assets don’t load, clear any caching and hard-refresh the browser.
- If you are working from source, run `npm install` and `npm run build`, then ensure the contents of the `build/` directory are present.


e.g.

1. Upload the plugin files to the `/wp-content/plugins/call-to-action-block` directory, or install the plugin through the WordPress plugins screen directly.
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' screen in WordPress

the /assets directory or the directory that contains the stable readme.txt (tags or trunk). Screenshots in the /assets
directory take precedence. For example, `/assets/screenshot-1.png` would win over `/tags/4.3/screenshot-1.png`
(or jpg, jpeg, gif).

== Arbitrary section ==

You may provide arbitrary sections, in the same format as the ones above. This may be of use for extremely complicated
plugins where more information needs to be conveyed that doesn't fit into the categories of "description" or
"installation." Arbitrary sections will be shown below the built-in sections outlined above.
